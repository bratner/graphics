===============================================================================

You have received a directory tree whose root contains the following
subdirectories:
	doc: contains TeX-source doc, man pages, et. al.
	examples: contains sample programs, and a Makefile
	src/srgp: source for SRGP package and the tiny GEOM package

The creation of the SRGP library requires an ANSI C compiler, like the freeware
GNU C compiler (gcc).  For important information on the proper use of gcc,
particularly its compatibility with other compilers,, consult the aptly named
file in the "doc/" directory.  The information in that file is important for
you and for all SRGP application developers.

The makefile in this "root" directory will make the SRGP library and a set of
example "test" applications.  The directory "src/srgp/" contains the source
files used to create the library.  The directory "examples/" contains the
application source files, and a README that describes the use and purpose of
most of the example programs.

The Makefile in the "src/srgp/" directory may need to modified to account for
differences between gcc and your machine's native cc.  In particular, you may
need to add an compiler option that identifies your machine via a defined
macro.  For example, on Sun Sparcstations, the macro "sparc" is automatically
defined by Sun's cc but not by gcc.  This doesn't affect SRGP, but it
drastically affects SPHIGS; see the Makefile in "sphigs/src/sphigs/" for more
information.  On your machine, even SRGP may be affected, so be aware!

In the "doc/" directory, you'll find the SRGP reference manual, a must for any
application developer.  The manual is provided in two incarnations, one for Mac
and one for X11/UNIX.  Each incarnation is offered in three printing formats:
plain ASCII text (.txt), PostScript (.ps), and TeX (.tex).  If you wish to use
the TeX source, you *must* consult the Makefile for instructions on how to
modify the TeX source to produce the code that should be fed to your local
"tex" program.

In the "doc/" directory, there is also a UNIX-style manpage in the usual nroff
format.

In the "src/srgp/" directory you'll find the source for both the Macintosh and
X versions of SRGP.  Most files are used in both versions; some files (whose
names have obvious suffixes) apply only to one version.  

If you are interested in installing the Mac version, you must read the file
"CopyToMac_instructions" in the "src/srgp/" directory.
