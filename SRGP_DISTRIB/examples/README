UNIX platform users: 
Please read the Makefile for information on building executables for SRGP
applications.

Mac platform users: See the MacSRGP_README file.

Here are brief descriptions of some of the test applications.


   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
			X_demo_anim *or* MAC_demo_anim

This is the very same program that was shown in the Addison-Wesley booth at
SIGGRAPH.  A nice way to become familiar with SRGP's basic functionality and
see what SRGP application source code looks like.  The Mac version creates a
window that fits on the MacII; the X version assumes the availability of much
more screen real estate.  If you are using a Mac Plus or Mac SE, this demo is
not of much use at all; much of the action will be off-screen.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
				 test_locator

This program places the keyboard in RAW EVENT mode, and continuously displays
the deluxe locator measure.  It is an excellent way to get to know SRGP's
locator.  If it looks like the modifier chord and timestamp aren't working, you
may want to re-read the reference manual's section on input carefully; they are
supposed to reflect conditions as of the most recent mouse-button state change.

You use the keyboard to control the locator's mode:
    i -- inactive
    s -- sample (display is updated 3 times a second)
    e -- event

You also use the keyboard to control the echo attribute:
    c -- cursor
    l -- rubber line
    r -- rubber rect

You can control the button mask in this way:
    1 -- toggles the status of the LEFT button in the button mask
		 ... etc. ...   for 2 (MIDDLE) and 3 (RIGHT)

You quit by typing:
     q -- QUIT

   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
		                 test_keyboard

Tests keyboard in RAW EVENT mode only.  Each time you hit a key, a display
of the deluxe keyboard measure's fields is updated.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
		              testcolor_and_resize  

For 8-bit-deep framebuffer support only.  Creates a lovely, relaxing image of
red fading into blue.  A vertical bisecting line and a horizontal bisecting
line are then XOR'd over the image to divide the window into four quadrants.
When you resize the window, the image is redrawn and the bisectors 
recalculated and redrawn.  The code shows how to use SRGP's resize callback
and how to load the SRGP color table.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
		     show_patterns *or* MAC_show_patterns

Simply displays all the built-in patterns and their corresponding indices.  The
MAC one assumes the screen real estate of a Mac II, and thus goes off the edge
on a Plus/SE.


   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
				  testrubber

The left mouse button adds a new line to the screen.  The right mouse button
just changes the current anchor point.  Entering a 'Q' on the keyboard quits.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
				  testpixmap

A poorly named demo, because it does a bit (no pun intended) more than that.
It loads a pixmap from a file and fills an oval with it.  Press down the mouse
button to see it load two identical bitmaps from a file and fill again.
Release the mouse button to see the result of a change in foreground color and
bitmap pattern index.  One more click terminates the demo.  WARNING: CANNOT BE
RUN ON THE Mac -- MacSRGP does not yet support pixmaps.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
				   testpaint

Each mouse button paints a different primary color.  Holding down more than one
mouse button produces a "blend" of primary colors.  Basically shows the use of
the locator in sample mode, which in this version of SRGP is not blazingly
fast.  (NOTE: works even on monochrome screens, because of its use of patterns
as a secondary attribute.)
To exit, issue an interrupt from the UNIX shell or (on Mac) click in close box.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
			       testeditkeyboard

Shows the use of the keyboard in edit mode.  You are asked to enter first a
number, than a string.  The first "number" characters in the string you enter
will be echoed.  To get the full effect, using the backspace key to correct
typos as you use the keyboard to enter information.  
To exit, issue an interrupt from the UNIX shell or (on Mac) click in close box.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
				 testtimestamp

Each time you click the left mouse button, the current SRGP timestamp value is
printed.  Much ado about nothing.  
To exit, issue an interrupt from the UNIX shell or (on Mac) click in close box.
