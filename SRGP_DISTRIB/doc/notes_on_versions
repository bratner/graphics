SRGP Version 1.0(c) -- RELEASED 17 Feb 91

Improved efficiency of SRGP_waitEvent().  When called with a negative parameter
(meaning no timeout event is desired), it will enter a true wait state,
requiring no CPU cycles.  This can help out when X terminals instead of X
workstations are being used.  Be aware: no improved efficiency of sample mode
has been achieved, nor is a call to SRGP_waitEvent() with a non-negative
parameter any more efficient.

SRGP Version 1.0(b) -- RELEASED 18 Jan 91
