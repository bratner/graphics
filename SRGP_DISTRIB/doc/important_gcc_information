The makefiles that have been provided for you assume you have GNU's freeware
ANSI C compiler, which should be used (barring the availability of another ANSI
C compiler) to create the SRGP library.

The object files created by GNU's compiler are compatible with objects created
by other C compilers only if the flag "-fpcc-struct-return" is sent to gcc.
All the makefiles I have provided indeed set that flag.

It is important to note that when that flag is set, the resulting object files
are NOT compatible with objects created by gcc with*out* that flag set.  All
application authors who wish to use the SRGP library are encouraged to use gcc,
so they can take advantage of prototypes, but these authors must be informed of
the importance of the flag!

If you are a system administrator or a lecturer in charge of a class using
SRGP, please provide them with sample Makefiles and stress the flag's
importance.
